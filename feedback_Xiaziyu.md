There are 3 flaws in my formative ICA.
The first one is about week4 practical.
It said I had no content that was different from the template file.
So I made some changes in the file.
The second one is about week6 practical.
It said I did not include a title.
So I added the title to the pie chart.
The third one is about week6 practical too.
It said my plot was quite odd.
So I changed the 'Notch' from 'True' to 'False'.
