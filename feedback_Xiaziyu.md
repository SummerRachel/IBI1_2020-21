There are 3 flaws in my formative ICA.
The first one is about week4 practical.
It said I had no content that was different from the template file.
So I add some words in the file.
The second one is about pie.py in the week6 practical.
It said my pie chart did not include a title.
So I added the title to the pie chart.
The third one is about list.py in the week6 practical.
It said my box plot was quite odd.
So I changed the 'Notch' from 'True' to 'False' to make it normal.
