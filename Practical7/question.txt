Question:
How have new cases and total cases developed over time in China?

Question Code starts at line 50th

1.For the number of total cases in China, it was increasing all the time.
And it increased rapidly between 2020-01-24 and 2020-03-04.
2.For the number of new cases in China, it was bigger than 0 between 2020-01-24 and 2020-03-04, while other time it was 0 or a bit bigger than 0.
The results are within my expectation.
That is because during the time between 2020-01-24 and 2020-03-04, China had a massive outbreak of the disease. After this time period, the government had taken a series of measures to lower the number of new cases thus the increase of total cases slowed down.
